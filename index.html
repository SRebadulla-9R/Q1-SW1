        <h2 style="color: #03045e;">What is Volleyball?</h2>
        <p style= "color: #0077b6;">Volleyball is a sport involving a ball that is usually colored yellow & blue or plain white. It is a game where there are two teams on both sides of the court that is divided by a net. A game consists of <em> two teams with six players </em> and it usually has <em> 2-3 sets. </em> Players must pass the ball using their forearms or their hands. Before the game starts one player has to serve the ball to the other side. Both teams must avoid the ball from hitting the floor or the opposing team will get a point.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#03045e;">My Experience with Volleyball </h2>
        <p style="color:#0077b6"> When it was the pandemic I started watching animes, some youtube videos, and even competitions about volleyball on the tv. As the years go by I finally decided to pursue volleyball, when it was July-August 2024. Volleyball is one of the things im most passionate about aside from studying and all my other hobbies. I practice and go to training everyday just for volleyball.</p>
